So in each of my citations I cited my specific page: "https://ziixx.net/projects/MaPS2022.html"
I'm not sure if it's just me, but that feels weird to me. They put in the work so it shouldn't be 
cited to my own personal website and page. But, in the end, I decided to add it because if someone did
want to come and find the original source for the posters, I believe that my website was a satisfactory
method for that. I have all of my contact info on here and I have all the authors' contact infos in turn. 

I don't think this will be a huge issue, in total, but it is something I wanted to make clear.
