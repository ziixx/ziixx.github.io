				<h1>Mahtomedi MaPS Teams' 2022 Posters for EB</h1>
        <img src="../img/MaPS2022TeamPicture.jpg" alt="Team Picture" style="width:100%; height:100;">
        <p>This was a wonderful experience and conference where 14 high school students raised funds and researched complex topics for roughly a year, culminating
          in a presentation at the largest biology conference in the country. I am truly grateful to have been a part of this. Briefly, I want to mention my highlights
          of the EB conference.
          <br>1. Obviously, the poster session
          <br>2. Raiding every single booth in the exhibit hall with Kaelyn
          <br>3. Seeing the Mutter Museum
          <br>4. Dim Sum and Mango Smoothie excursions into chinatown
          <br>
          </p>

             of all of their permission and THEIR hard work. If you use these posters for any reason, please cite them. There should be the appropriate citation
