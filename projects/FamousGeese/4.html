					<h2>Marcus Junius Brutus & Gaius Cassius Longinus</h2>
					<p>Marcus Junius Brutus (left) is most famous for his betrayl of Caesar and, specifically, the depiction of that moment in the Shakespeare play (E tu Brute?).
						However, following the assisination, Brutus made two decisions that were arguably just as influential. Against the probing of the Cassius and
						Marcus Tullius Cicero (his two cloest anti-Caesarian allies) he refused to send all his legions to fight Antony twice instead preferring to "wait it out"
						and let the Caesarian faction infight. Doing this, Brutus gave Antony a second chance which ultimately saw the demise of Brutus, Cassisus, and Cicero.
						<br>
						Gaius Cassius Longinus (right) was a conspirator in the assasination of Caesar. Likely the second most influential assasin, Cassius held much power during the 2nd
						civil war. Cassius is pictured here trying to convince Brutus to do something.
						<br>
						btw, togas (loose fitting cloth) are hard to draw especially on Geese
