		<h3 style="color: #42bc7f">The Event</h3><hr>
		<p>This was a workshop put on by my history of early modern philosophy professor, Jessica Gordon-Roth, and two of her colleagues, Dwight K. Lewis and Bennet McNulty. 
			The event's stated purpose was to encourage a more inclusive way of teaching the period (i.e. to 'expand the philosophical canon') in order to fight, one, 
			the homogeniety of philosophy as a profession and, two, the idea that philosophy was and is only done by straight white men. All participants were expected to
			end the program having created a syllabus that they could use the next time they taught the class (The program is for professors). I was a student volunteer 
			there to help run things smoothly, and in return I got to talk to cool people. I also made a syllabus.</p>

		<p>I returned once again this year! And once again it was a highlight of the year! Talking to and being around so many cool and amazing philosophers doing philosophy, I learned so much. 
			I noticed also, this year I felt much less internal pressure throughtout the conference, so it was that much more enjoyable! I didn't produce anything, so I didn't think it warranted another page,
			but what I do have this time is pictures:

		<!-- <h3 style="color: #42bc7f">The People</h3><hr>
		<p>By far, the best part of the event were the different people I heard from and talked to. In no particular order, I would like to write a short note on a good many of them.
			<br>Enrique Chavez-Arviso: Enrique was the quickest to invite me into the conversation and continued to do so. On the first day, as people were getting off the elevator,
			I was tasked with directing people to the door. Understandably, most thanked me for the directions and proceeded. Enrique, stopped, gave me a fist bump, introduced himself,
			and asked my name. Then, during lunch, he sat with me and we talked about why I (a high schooler) was there, what I wanted to do, and what his story was. It continued like 
			this throughout the conference. Say hi to the paragon birds for me, Enrique!
			<br>Natalia Strok: During the second day, I sat down with Enrique and Natalia and after Enrique informed Natalia that I "spoke" (quotations my own) spanish, they proceeded 
			on continuing their conversation in fluent spanish. I, of course, was unable to participate at the same level. However, it was nonetheless rather exciting listening to 
			two natives speak. I got about 50% of the conversation. After Enrique left, I had a wonderful conversation with Natalia. We talked more in depth about language and its 
			importance for understanding other people and especially older texts. Translations, believe it or not, are rather subpar. Also, during the evening events, Natalia would 
			be one of maybe two who would ride with me to the events.
