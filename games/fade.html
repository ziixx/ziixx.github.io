				<p>Latest patch: 1.0.1<br>- Removed map exploit that i should have found before i released the game<br>- made the last level easier, its kinda super hard rn</p>
					- Made some basic quality of life improvements<br>- Hope you enjoy!</p>
					<p>I am currently done with the development of Fade, if I feel inspired I may come back and add more levels or features or to patch bugs, but for now this is the way it will remain.</p>
